                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I am Yan Ting Leung, also known as Joey or Ennil online. 
                            I am currently a linguistics student in Simon Fraser University
                            enrolled in computing science minor who is learning software development to achieve my dream -- to make games.

                    <p style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0px;">How do I end up here</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 30px;">I was born in Hong Kong in 2003 and finished my high school there. 
                        By that time there were still frequent protesting in Hong Kong, and my family,
                        holding opinions against all teenagers in sight, 
                        would often have political opinions at the dinning table and starting heated arguments.
                        Seeking for a quiet place to continue my studying and life, 
                        I planned to study abord, and I eventually made it into Simon Fraser University, in BC, Canada.

                    <p style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 75px; margin-bottom: 0px;">"Alex"</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">The logo at the right is a simplified drawing of "Alex" from an unfinished comic of mine,
                        since I keep mentioning him and his iconic smile not just in front of my friends,
                        but also have been sneaking him into my drawings as an easter egg, 
                        he has been serving as my unofficial logo, profile picture and a kind of signiture.</p>
